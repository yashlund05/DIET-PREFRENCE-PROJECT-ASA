Descriptive Statistics, Visualization & Statistical Testing
This repository contains solutions for two Applied Statistical Analysis projects: Project I (Descriptive Statistics & Visualization) and Project II (Statistical Testing). These projects together provide a comprehensive introduction to data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and hypothesis testing.

Project Overview
Project I: Focuses on data cleaning, summary statistics, outlier detection, and visualizing data distributions and relationships using scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices.

Project II: Builds on descriptive analysis with inferential statistics including t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests, and correlation to compare groups, test dependencies, and validate hypotheses with visual and tabular results.

These projects are designed for learners aiming to develop a strong foundation in data science workflows, from initial data exploration to statistical inference.

Features
Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, standardizing numeric data.

Descriptive statistics: mean, median, standard deviation, frequency distributions.

Visualization: scatter plots, histograms, box plots, correlation heatmaps.

Statistical testing: independent and paired t-tests, one-way and two-way ANOVA, chi-square tests for categorical data.

Clear visual representation of statistical results through plots and summary tables.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy (install via pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy)

Installation
Clone this repository:

text
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-statistics.git
cd project-statistics
Place your dataset(s) in the /data folder.

Running the Projects
Follow the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts corresponding to each project step.

Project I notebook/script covers preprocessing, descriptive stats, and visualization.

Project II proceeds with hypothesis testing and interpretation.

Usage
Modify file paths or parameters in notebooks/scripts to match your dataset.

Extend analyses or add new visualizations/statistical tests as necessary.

Use plots and statistical summaries for reports or presentations.

Results
Provides insight into data characteristics, trends, and anomalies.

Validates differences and relationships statistically with clear interpretation.

Supports reproducible and educational workflows in applied statistics.
